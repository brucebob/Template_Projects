				Template_Projects Project Overview
========================================================================
header files use to test the containers to prove that the containers are not buggy
TestSuite.h - used to add unit tests for the container and it's functionality
MemoryTracker.h used to keep track of news and deletes so not leaks are made
all tests are stored in the UnitTesting.cpp

========================================================================
					List of Containers

1. SortedList - sorts elements as they are added to the container
2. BSTree - binary tree container for fast searches
3. TreapTree - binary tree with a balancing so leaves are not O(n)
